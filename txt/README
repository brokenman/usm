	make STRIP_COMMENTS="false" install

Requirements
============

Gtkdialog >= 0.8.3 - http://code.google.com/p/gtkdialog/
Slackware 14.1+
su gui helper such as kdesu, gksu, gnsu or ktsuss

Operation
=========

CLI
---------
The command line interface can be called by calling /usr/bin/usm
directly from a console. Please see 'man usm' for more info.

GUI
---------
When /usr/bin/usm is called via a third party then the gui is involed.
An example is /usr/bin/usmgui which simply calls /usr/bin/usm so that
the gui may be launched from menus and other scripts.
